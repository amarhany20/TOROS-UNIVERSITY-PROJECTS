				<h3>Introduction :</h3>
			 <p>My name is Ammar Hany Ezeldin Abdelrazik. I am 20 years old. I am an Egyptian. I currently live in Mersin Turkey. I have been living in  Mersin for 3 years. Since I left Egypt I have been living alone. I have a 1 sister. My father works as an Interior Architecture. I graduated from  Mersin Evrensel Kültür Anadolu Lisesi. I am a Computer And Software Engineering Student at Toros University in Mersin. I chose Computer And Software Engineering as I think that's it's the future.</p>
				
				<h3>Why did I come to Turkey :</h3>
				<p>When I was young I had a dream of going to a foreign country to complete my education. When I was 16 years old my father asked me that he knows a friend that can help him transfer me to a school in Turkey to complete my education. I was very happy because I had a lot of friends in Turkey from online games, I watched a lot of Turkish series and I also went to Turkey when I was young in 2010 as a tourist and it was one of the best experiences I had. So, without thinking I agreed with my father but he kept on telling me it would be hard because you will be living alone in a foreign country but that didn't change my mind.</p>
				
				<h3>Why Did I choose Computer And Software Engineering :</h3>
				<p>I chose Computer And Software Engineering because I feel like it's an unlimited universe where you can do anything you want like Making and designing websites, Programming Games, or even making utility programs. Since I was young I had a dream of being a game developer. so, I started learning unity and unreal engine but then I found out it requires a lot of programming knowledge. I started learning it on the internet then I found out it's another universe. I really loved the idea of "If I can think it, I can make it." that's what made me join Computer and Software Engineering.</p>
				
				<h3>My first semester in Toros University :</h3>
				<p>My first semester at Toros University was hard as I was adapting to the new academic education but the professors helped us a lot at the start, they explained everything to us and that's what made it easier by the time. I found a hard time understanding C# because it felt like a new world that I don't understand anything in but my programming professor really taught me well. Every week, he showed us examples and gave us some challenges and then taught us how to do it until it became much easier and thanks to him now I understand a lot about programming fundamentals and C#. I also had another lesson that talked about algorithms. It was very hard at the start but we had a good professor also. he taught us well and gave us a lot of examples about algorithms but  I didn't know it's important there but now I think it's the most important lesson because whenever I do a project or a program, without the algorithm I can't even start it.</p>
